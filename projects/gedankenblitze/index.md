<h2>The Assignment</h2>

The assignment was to create an algorithm that had to be sketched on paper by 10 test persons. Content of the algorithm was a simple drawing instruction after defining parameters like tools, format, time and material. The description should be precise and easy to execute while leaving room for free interpretation. Further on, more iterations were conducted by changing parameters of the algorithm to improve its description and output. 

„Analog algorithm“ was the first assignment of »Designing with code – the basic of generative design« by Fabian Morón Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.
