## Description
The following project is about our analysis of pictograms made by Otto "Otl" Aicher for the Olympic Games 1972.
Our focus was on the correlation to common laws of gestalt and generative art, the main subject of our course.

The assignment was part of the course [Gestalten in Code – Die Grundlagen Generativer Gestaltung](https://incom.org/workspace/6886) held by [Fabian Morón Zirfas](http://fabianmoronzirfas.me/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/) in winter 2016/2017.

## Assignment
The assignment was an introduction into the huge subject of computer generated art. Based on a given list we picked Otl Aicher for a few reasons: Aicher's art is still popular and his pictograms are used worldwide in plenty different industries. We figured that pictograms can be easily applied to different laws of gestalt. Furtermore, the assignment included a detailed analysis of a single project or a series. The next step was to actually use a few laws of gestalt to create something new based on the found information of the analysis.

## Otto "Otl" Aicher
Before we dive into the analysis we want to give a short summary of Otl Aicher: born in 1922 in Ulm Aicher was a leading German graphic- and typedesigner. He was one of the founding fathers of the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Ulm, Germany and created the pictograms for the Olympic Games 1972. Another well known project is the corporate design development of the German airline Lufthansa. In short: Aicher was part of defining the european design history.

## Analysis
For our analysis we picked the best known project of Otl Aicher: his pictograms, firstly made for the Olympic Games in 1972, later extracted into hundreds of pictograms for completely different industries. A pictogram is *an icon that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblence to a physical object* ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram)). We picked two of the original pictograms to analyse them further: the pictogram for **athletics** as well as **fencing**.

![Pictograms](https://github.com/MalteVoelkner/gestalten-in-code/blob/master/projects/otl-aicher/assets/images/Pictograms.png)

Our focus was based on three factors: **similarities**, **differences** and **possibilites**. External similarities are a similiar allocation of the body party as well as resembling proportions in all pictograms. The upper and lower body is split in every pictogram and the person is always in a dynamic posture, for example someone running or throwing something. Characteristics found in every pictogramm are that they always are a symbol for the sport they are portraying. An objective analysis shows, that the pictograms are always 2D without any depth effects. The persons are filled with black and show no mimic or emotions. Based on these facts we were able to create a first guideline for creating a pictogram:

+ Black pictogram on a white background
+ Modular body with the same body parts
+ Same gap between upper and lower body
+ Only 45°/90°/135°-angles

A big insight was, that besides the above listed rules - every pictogram is different. They are not aligned on a template-grid, they do not always have the same proportion-size, they do not have the same gaps between external items (like the sword for fencing). An example for the missing grid is below.
