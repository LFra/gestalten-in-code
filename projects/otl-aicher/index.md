## Description
The following project is about our analysis of pictograms made by Otto "Otl" Aicher for the Olympic Games 1972.
Our focus was on the correlation to common laws of gestalt and generative art, the main subject of our course.

The assignment was part of the course [Gestalten in Code – Die Grundlagen Generativer Gestaltung](https://incom.org/workspace/6886) held by [Fabian Morón Zirfas](http://fabianmoronzirfas.me/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/) in winter 2016/2017.

## Assignment
The assignment was an introduction into the huge subject of computer generated art. Based on a given list we picked Otl Aicher for a few reasons: Aicher's art is still popular and his pictograms are used worldwide in plenty different industries. We figured that pictograms can be easily applied to different laws of gestalt. Furtermore, the assignment included a detailed analysis of a single project or a series. The next step was to actually use a few laws of gestalt to create something new based on the found information of the analysis.

## Otto "Otl" Aicher
Before we dive into the analysis we want to give a short summary of Otl Aicher: born in 1922 in Ulm Aicher was a leading German graphic- and typedesigner. He was one of the founding fathers of the Hochschule für Gestaltung in Ulm, Germany and created the pictograms for the Olympic Games 1972. Another well known project is the corporate design development of the German airline Lufthansa. In short: Aicher was part of defining the european design history.

## Analysis
For our analysis we picked the best known project of Otl Aicher: his pictograms, firstly made for the Olympic Games in 1972, later extracted into hundreds of pictograms for completely different industries. A pictogram is *an icon that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblence to a physical object* ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram)). We picked two of the original pictograms to analyse them further.
