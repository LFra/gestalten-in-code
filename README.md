## Gestalt psychology - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

>Gestalt psychology or gestaltism (German: Gestalt […°…ôÀà Étalt] "shape, form") is a theory of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology tries to understand the laws of our ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies.

## Introduction  

What does it means to design with code? Is it a way of thinking? Is it a tool? Is it just the flavour of the month? (Spoiler: It is not IMHO). In this repository I try to sum up my various experiments on "gestalten in code".
